 # FirstNationsVillage v0.5.2-alpha

Don't download this piece of **** unless you want metaphysical cancer.

This is version 0.4 and is still undergoing alpha testing. Therefore, it has bugs... comment if you have any suggestions, improvements or other things like that. Any help is greatly appreciated. 

# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
1. Download and extract the .zip file (Clone to desktop).
2. Run FirstNationsVillage.exe inside the folder
Note: Progress doesn't save... so yeah... 

Thanks and farewell!
